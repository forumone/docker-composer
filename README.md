# About this Image

Images built from this repository are parallel implementations of the Docker Hub's [`library/composer`](https://hub.docker.com/_/composer) image.

* Supported PHP versions: 8.3, 8.2, 8.1, 8.0
* Supported Composer versions: 2.7, 2.6, 2.5, 2.4, 2.3, 2.2

Tags are constructed using `${COMPOSER_VERSION}-php-${PHP_VERSION}`. For example, Composer 2.7 running on PHP 8.3 is `2.7-php-8.3`.
